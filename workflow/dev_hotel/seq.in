Hello, I'm planning a trip to Cambridge and I'm looking for a place to dine. It should be moderately priced and located in the centre.
Great I also need a place to stay that is a guesthouse that includes free parking.
Any location is fine, but I would prefer something that is in the expensive price range.
Okay, I guess it'll save me some dough if I try for a place that's more moderately priced.
Any of them will do. Pick your favorite and let me know what area they're in, and their postcode and how many stars they have?
Thank you. That is all I need today.
