No thanks. I do need a train, though. I'll be leaving Cambridge on Saturday.
I am going to London Liverpool Street, I would like to arrive by 17:00.
That train would be just fine. I need the train ID, price and depart time.
No, I'll just need the price, please?
No, thank you for all your help.
Can you help me find a nice 4 star hotel?
Yes, I do. I would like a hotel that is expensive in price.
The one in the centre would be ideal. There will be 7 people staying for 2 nights, starting Tuesday.
Yes, I'm also looking for a train departing from Cambridge and heading to Stansted Airport. Can you please help?
I want a train for tuesday that departs after 09:30
Yes, please choose the earliest one after 09:30 and book it for 7 people. And don't forget to send the reference number!
That is all I needed, good day to you.
Thanks. I'm also looking for a hotel (not a guesthouse) with free wifi.
No particular price range but I would like it to be in the centre.
Yes that will work. Can I get the hotel's phone number?
No, that will be all, thank you for your help!
Thanks, have a good day.
I am also looking for a place to eat in the expensive price range that serves chinese, can you help me with that too?
That sounds perfect. Can you tell me their phone number?
Not at this time, but thank you. I appreciate your help.
