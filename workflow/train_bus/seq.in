How much does it cost to take the bus in Cambridge?
I will be traveling to london.
I am also looking for a hotel in the west side of Cambridge. Can you help me?
I want a hotel on the west side that doesn't have to include internet. If no internet, what about free wifi?
Are you sure that there are no hotels on the west side of town? With or without internet?
