Hi, I am looking for a hotel to stay in in east cambridge.
The hotel in question ideally would be in the expensive price range. It doesn't need to have free parking, though.
If there are not any hotels that do not include free parking then that place will do.
There will be 3 guests for 2 nights starting Sunday.
Would it be possible to book this for one night?
Yes, I also need a train to Birmingham New Street.
I would like to depart from cambridge on monday.
Yes please, for the same 3 people. And can I have the reference number?
No, that'll be all. Thank you so much for all of your help!
